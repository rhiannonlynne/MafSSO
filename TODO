Things to do to improve code:

- add summaryMetric: calculate (mean?median?identity?)X at H value

- move "appMag" / SNR / VISibility calculations into stackers, which are run *at each slicepoint* (right before metrics calculated)
 (object stackers will be run then, instead of only once per gathering of data)

- move completeness / integrateH to reduce functions

- add inherit from BaseMetric to baseMoMetric

- where else can we integrate mo* and base*?
  - sqlconstraint -> constraint? (how different are pandasConstraints vs sqlconstraints?)
  - update write method on all slicers to take metricBundle instead of individual parameters
